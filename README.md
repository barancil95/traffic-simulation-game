# traffic-simulation-game
This is a project made with my two other classmates Semih and Ahmet.It is a javafx game that includes 5 different levels.Main goal is that player should control the lights in order for cars to safely travel to locations without exceeding crashing limits.
We implemented all the basic car functionality according to that goal, enjoy!
